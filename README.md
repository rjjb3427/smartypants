## README
Application is located at -  https://murmuring-caverns-23753.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up </br>
Admin dashboard currently has no password - https://murmuring-caverns-23753.herokuapp.com/admin

## TODO

1. Well This Application looks like crap in Heroku, I need to figure out whats going on
  - Possible solution would be to dockerize the app but that would require so much more work that I don't feel like doing.
2. Add a different rescue message for the admin dashboard.
